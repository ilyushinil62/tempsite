      <title>Accessibility / Moderation</title>
      <link>https://potentia.moe/blog/accessibility/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The indie web, as of late, seems to have had an increased focus accessibility. In my eyes, this is an excellent shift in the right direction, but I also feel as though some have allowed it to directly hinder their creative processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into my rationale behind my thoughts, I&#39;d like to preface my argument with the following: My site is not at all accessible, and quite frankly I need to actually make it mobile accessible as it&#39;s scrapped versions were. Despite this, I do strongly believe that sites should be accessible, but only &lt;em&gt;to a certain degree.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That degree is the key component; I fully encourage people to make their site as easy to use for as many people as possible, but I also don&#39;t think this should be done at the compromise of style (within reason; don&#39;t make your site cause seizures). I&#39;ve seen several sites completely lose their identities in their pursuit of being &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; accessible as possible, but the reality is that the results of optimizing your site for accessibility are diminishing past a certain point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#39;t have to deprive your site of any chance of having visual uniqueness just because one color is slightly less legible than the other. If your site is able to scale to varying screen sizes, and is fully compatible with a screen reader, than your site is perfectly accessible to 99% of the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many people seem to believe that their sites are far more serious than they are, but the reality is that, unless you&#39;re for some reason on Nekoweb/Neocities to host your portfolio, your site is a form of artistic expression. It&#39;s greatest purpose is to serve as a representation of yourself, and what you find to be visibly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not at all obligated to adhere to a set of visual standards just because they&#39;re the most accessible, and quite frankly, it saddens me to see sites grow more uniform in their adherence to these rules. As with everything in life, accessibility should be approached with moderation. You should not have your site entirely absurd visually, but you also should not leave your site entirely bland for the sake of accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: dont be as dumb as i am, but also dont recreate the apple site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cheers, tm&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Site, Same Mistakes</title>
      <link>https://potentia.moe/blog/newsite/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, after many months, I&#39;ve returned to being a webmaster once more. I can&#39;t say this is as good as the site some of you all were once familiar with, but nonetheless, it&#39;s mine. I&#39;ve posted some blog posts already, albeit, don&#39;t expect too much of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s good to be back, and I&#39;ll resume my regular posting activities. Thanks to everyone who&#39;s helped me make this site version. I&#39;d greatly appreciate feedback in the guestbook if you&#39;re so inclined. I certainly need to improve portions of this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for visiting my website. I hope you find it to be serviceable. It&#39;s the product of months of messing around aimlessly. I don&#39;t know what to say on site introductions, I&#39;m honestly just filling the space at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DNIs Are (Still) Useless</title>
      <link>https://potentia.moe/blog/dnis/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As is customary with the creation of a new blog, I feel it my duty to immediately express my more controversial views on subjects related to the indie web community. I&#39;ll put it flat out, I think DNIs are useless at the most fundamental level. Placing a DNI on your site will not, in the majority of cases, stop certain groups from interacting with you, and in practice, merely provoke the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, I haven&#39;t anything against the Do Not Interact list (henceforth referred to as DNI). As I&#39;ll touch on briefly in the more opinionated portion of this post, I do feel as though they can have an unintended social impact, but some people do have a genuine reason to wish to not interact with certain groups. But, it&#39;s for people exactly like this that nearly every platform has implemented an &#39;ignore&#39; or &#39;block&#39; system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNIs do not operate at the system level; they are solely dependent on the goodwill of the very same groups you inadvertently targeted with your list. You already lack enough trust in these groups to even allow them to interact with you, and yet you are now solely relying on their ability to listen to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; for them to not interact with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By publicly advertising the people you dislike on your website, in a conveniently bulleted list, you&#39;re essentially requesting for them to taunt you. Human nature often means that someone who is hated will hate the person who hates them reflectively, and because of this, the very parties you targeted your DNI against will now be going after you in the easiest way possible, by interacting with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this would have, or could have, happened if people were to simply rely on the conveniently available blocking features on nearly every modern social service, or even just simply IP ban those who bother you from your guestbook, should they indulge in it&#39;s usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And quite frankly, it&#39;s because of how easy it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to use a DNI, and how dysfunctional a DNI is at fulfilling it&#39;s advertised purpose, that I feel as though many utilize DNIs for an ulterior purpose: virtue signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNI is not inherently a list of people you don&#39;t wish to interact with you, but rather, a convenient demonstrator of the morals which you adhere to; it&#39;s reducing your beliefs into a simple list as to paint yourself as a better person than you are, for your own actions are unable to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All a DNI has done, is doing, and will do, for a website is cause the exact opposite of the intended impact, and quite frankly, I don&#39;t believe people care. DNIs have been warped beyond meaning to the point where they merely represent a moral circlejerk largely participated in by impressionable youths who know no better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Problematic Media</title>
      <link>https://potentia.moe/blog/problematicmedia/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the (admittedly unrefined and now deleted) first post of this blog, I briefly discussed the factors that influence our perceptions of right and wrong. One of those factors was media. And it is because of this that I view the constant hostility toward media containing problematic content as downright foolish; for it is not media that encourages the populace to partake in activities deemed wrong by society, but rather, it is media’s depiction of such activities that pushes this belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my eyes, media that is problematic in nature can largely be classified into two fields; however, it is possible for media to simultaneously exist in both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first field, which henceforth shall be referred to as the &amp;quot;point-driven&amp;quot; form of problematic media, serves to bolster society’s views of right and wrong by portraying often uncomfortable subjects in a realistic light. This media doesn’t exist to endorse problematic actions but rather serves to depict the horrors of them. The best-known example of this, in my eyes, would be &lt;em&gt;Of Mice and Men&lt;/em&gt; and similar books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second field, which henceforth shall be referred to as the &amp;quot;escapism-driven&amp;quot; form of problematic media, largely exists to provide a source of escapism for the consumer. This is content that, while problematic in nature through the eyes of some, is grounded so loosely in reality that it’s foolish to take as social commentary. Think of the &lt;em&gt;Rance&lt;/em&gt; series and other eroge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen both of these fields criticized equally, but I felt the differentiation was important to make prior to writing further; albeit, I feel as though both mediums are equally valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest criticism I’ve seen for media with problematic content is that such media serves to glorify or make light of often reprehensible subjects. Yet, I’d argue that, in the case of point-driven media, the complete opposite is true. To reuse my earlier example, &lt;em&gt;Of Mice and Men&lt;/em&gt; has garnered a great deal of criticism over the years and has frequently appeared on banned book lists due to its depiction of racism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to criticize this book or wish for it to be banned, in my eyes, is to do the complete opposite of advocating for greater moralism within our society. This is not a work that utilizes racism to push the agenda of some extremist party; it is a work that depicts racism as it truly appeared at one point in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are not to face the harsh realities of our world, and not to recognize them within our creative works, then the very morals which the critics of these works are seeking to uphold will fade with time. If we do not wish for the people of our world to learn morals through their own misfortunes, then it is ultimately the role of media to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, however, is a point which only applies to the aforementioned point-driven media, as opposed to escapism-driven media, which seems to be far more controversial on internet spaces as of late. This is media which is far easier to view as glorifying terrible actions due to the nature of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is media which serves not to provide social commentary, but to entertain. And it&#39;s in this purpose that I feel the hatred for such media grows rather pointless. Let us take the &lt;em&gt;Rance&lt;/em&gt; series as an example. &lt;em&gt;Rance&lt;/em&gt; is a series of games which revolves around, to word it nicely, repeated non-consensual sexual altarcations. There is absolutely no societal commentary in this series, but similarly, there isn&#39;t any advocacy to take such actions into reality either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my eyes, to depict an overly fantastical fantasy scenario in which there are no clear rules nor regulations set in place to counter such activities is not a mirror of reality. But rather, something solely created by the writer to entertain the delusions of the reader. This is not a piece of media which will drive people to take such actions in reality. And quite frankly, the very fact that they are actively seeking out a piece of media with such contents suggests that they have no intention to ever do so in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To utilize a more widely known example, I&#39;d compare it to the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; franchise, in that, by depicting such actions in an overly dramatized, and not whatsoever realistic manner, it is not advocating for gun violence; it is simply a form of predominantly mindless entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what the escapism-driven sect of media revolves around, they aren&#39;t inherently there to push any given moral agenda, but similarly, they don&#39;t exist to advocate for individuals to take actions of moral reprehensibility in reality. These are pieces of media which are actively sought out by individuals seeking entertainment, and there is little more to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I understand that it is difficult to accept such a thing, particularly for the more morally zealous individuals out there, but honestly: Why bother? You&#39;re going after a form of media consumed by people who will never match your moral ideals, and created by people who will never match your moral ideals. Attempting to cease this loop would be akin to somebody attempting to change your own beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your own moral system is so fragile that you feel as though a fictional scenario places it at risk, then I feel as though it&#39;s a mark of the inherently flawed nature of your beliefs, as opposed to a character flaw within those who consume escapism-driven problematic media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a society as increasingly complex and satirized as ours, it&#39;s essential that we mustn&#39;t take media at face value as instructions for how we must act, and quite frankly, I feel as though those who oppose problematic media view it as such. It&#39;s not a sign of virtue to wish for certain genres of media to be removed, it&#39;s a sign you lack the basic literacy needed to differentiate fiction from reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not care if you consume the same media as I, nor do I consume if you enjoy, or even tolerate, the same media as I. But I do feel as though the unjust hatred of &amp;quot;problematic&amp;quot; media is downright foolish, and in practice, has led to many developing a false sense of morality which will only hurt them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
