<p><em>i wrote this months ago when i felt bad and it's not particularly good but i wasnt sure what else i should put here yet as it was the only digitized poem i ahd on hand</em></p>
<p>name, name</p>
<p>they call my name</p>
<p>but, nonetheless</p>
<p>their attempts are in vain</p>
<p>the noise in my mind</p>
<p>does not gain</p>
<p>i nod at the order</p>
<p>i bow at the command</p>
<p>but to a name</p>
<p>i mustn't nod</p>
<p>nor bow</p>
<p>is it x?</p>
<p>is it y?</p>
<p>they ask,</p>
<p>but i dont reply</p>
<p>for i'd lie, if i were to comply</p>
<p>to say that their words did not pass me by</p>
<p>who am i?</p>
