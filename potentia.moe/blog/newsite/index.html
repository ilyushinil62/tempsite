<p>Well, after many months, I've returned to being a webmaster once more. I can't say this is as good as the site some of you all were once familiar with, but nonetheless, it's mine. I've posted some blog posts already, albeit, don't expect too much of them.</p>
<p>It's good to be back, and I'll resume my regular posting activities. Thanks to everyone who's helped me make this site version. I'd greatly appreciate feedback in the guestbook if you're so inclined. I certainly need to improve portions of this site.</p>
<p>Thanks for visiting my website. I hope you find it to be serviceable. It's the product of months of messing around aimlessly. I don't know what to say on site introductions, I'm honestly just filling the space at this point.</p>
