<p>im going to be so fr i wanted to write a serious review for this but i realized it was impossible. onimai means a lot to me and it got me through some pretty bad times when it was airing. it's not really that good, the jokes don't land, and it's only relatable to a small subset of people. i like onimai nonetheless. read it.</p>
