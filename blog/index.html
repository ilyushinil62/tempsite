								<p>The indie web, as of late, seems to have had an increased focus accessibility. In my eyes, this is an excellent shift in the right direction, but I also feel as though some have allowed it to directly hinder their creative processes.
Before I get into my rationale behind my thoughts, I&#39;d like to preface my argument with the following: My site is not at all accessible, and quite frankly I need to actually make it mobile accessible as it&#39;s scrapped versions were. Despite this, I do strongly believe that sites should be accessible, but only to a certain degree.
That degree is the key component;...</p>

								<p>Well, after many months, I&#39;ve returned to being a webmaster once more. I can&#39;t say this is as good as the site some of you all were once familiar with, but nonetheless, it&#39;s mine. I&#39;ve posted some blog posts already, albeit, don&#39;t expect too much of them.
It&#39;s good to be back, and I&#39;ll resume my regular posting activities. Thanks to everyone who&#39;s helped me make this site version. I&#39;d greatly appreciate feedback in the guestbook if you&#39;re so inclined. I certainly need to improve portions of this site.
Thanks for visiting my website. I hope you find it to be serviceable. It&#39;s the product of...</p>

								<p>As is customary with the creation of a new blog, I feel it my duty to immediately express my more controversial views on subjects related to the indie web community. I&#39;ll put it flat out, I think DNIs are useless at the most fundamental level. Placing a DNI on your site will not, in the majority of cases, stop certain groups from interacting with you, and in practice, merely provoke the opposite.
Conceptually, I haven&#39;t anything against the Do Not Interact list (henceforth referred to as DNI). As I&#39;ll touch on briefly in the more opinionated portion of this post, I do feel as though they can...</p>

								<p>In the (admittedly unrefined and now deleted) first post of this blog, I briefly discussed the factors that influence our perceptions of right and wrong. One of those factors was media. And it is because of this that I view the constant hostility toward media containing problematic content as downright foolish; for it is not media that encourages the populace to partake in activities deemed wrong by society, but rather, it is media’s depiction of such activities that pushes this belief.
In my eyes, media that is problematic in nature can largely be classified into two fields; however, it is...</p>
